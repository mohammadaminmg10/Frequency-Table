# Frequency Table Generator
This repo is a simple university project that generates a class frequency table for a given dataset.
The table shows the frequency of each data value within a specified range of the observations.
In this version of the code, you will need to manually enter the dataset directly into the code(I may fix it later).
This program requires the Go programming language to be installed. You can download Go from the official website: https://golang.org/
Feedback and suggestions for improvement are always appreciated.
